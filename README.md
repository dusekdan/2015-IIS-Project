## Information systems - Project in PHP with MySQL Database

One of the shittiest repositories on my GitHub account. Just go away and never come back. Everything was written on the go, with one eye, right hand and only one testicle. If you are stupid enough to copy any of this, be sure you'll end up infront of the disciplinary commission on FIT, Brno University of Technology.

And yes, it was for full 30/30 points.
